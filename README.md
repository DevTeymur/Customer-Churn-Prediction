## Description
Basic steps such done on data such as filling missing values, detecting outliers, normalization and scaling. The graphs that were sketched in the EDA section helped in order to decide which columns to normalize. Scaling of the futures is important as we use Logistic Regression which is distance-based. After completing these steps basic model was built. In order to improve the performance of our model cross-validation and feature elimination methods was implemented on data.
