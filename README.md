# Customer Churn Prediction with Logistic Regression

## Objective
The purpose of this project is to predict churn of every customer based on classification.

## Methods used
- Machine Learning
- Data Visualization
- Predictive Modeling

## Technologies
- Python
- Jupyter
- pandas, numpy, seaborn, matlotlib, sklearn, scipy, collections

## Description
Basic steps such done on data such as filling missing values, detecting outliers, normalization and scailing. The graphs that sketched in EDA section helped in order to decide which columns to normalize. Scailig of the futures is important as we use Logistic Regression which is distance based. After completing these steps basic model was built. In order to improve the performance of our model cross validation and fearure elimination method implemented on data.
